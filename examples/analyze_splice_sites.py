"""Splice Site Analysis Driver - Domain-Specific Chart Generation.

This script demonstrates how to use the splice agent for genomic splice site analysis
with guided, insightful visualizations rather than open-ended prompts.

Key Strategy for LLM-Generated Insights:
1. Provide domain context in prompts
2. Use structured analysis templates
3. Combine data queries with visualization requests
4. Let LLM choose best chart type for the question
5. Use reflection to ensure biological relevance

Usage Examples:

    # Run all template analyses (default)
    python examples/analyze_splice_sites.py --data data/splice_sites_enhanced.tsv

    # Run a specific analysis template
    python examples/analyze_splice_sites.py \
        --data data/splice_sites_enhanced.tsv \
        --analysis high_alternative_splicing \
        --model gpt-4o-mini

    # Available analysis templates:
    #   - high_alternative_splicing: Genes with most splice sites
    #   - splice_site_genomic_view: Genomic visualization of splice sites
    #   - site_type_distribution: Splice site types by chromosome

    # Run with reflection for higher quality (costs more)
    python examples/analyze_splice_sites.py \
        --data data/splice_sites_enhanced.tsv \
        --analysis high_alternative_splicing \
        --reflect \
        --reflection-model gpt-4o

    # Exploratory analysis with custom research question
    python examples/analyze_splice_sites.py \
        --data data/splice_sites_enhanced.tsv \
        --analysis exploratory \
        --question "What is the distribution of splice sites across different exon ranks?"

    # Filter to standard chromosomes only (chr1-22, chrX, chrY)
    python examples/analyze_splice_sites.py \
        --data data/splice_sites_enhanced.tsv \
        --standard-only

    # Use a different model (e.g., GPT-4 for better quality)
    python examples/analyze_splice_sites.py \
        --data data/splice_sites_enhanced.tsv \
        --model gpt-4o \
        --output-dir output/high_quality_analysis

    # Generate plots automatically (PNG + PDF) with captions and manifest
    python examples/analyze_splice_sites.py \
        --data data/splice_sites_enhanced.tsv \
        --analysis all \
        --execute

    # Full workflow: reflection + execution + custom models
    python examples/analyze_splice_sites.py \
        --data data/splice_sites_enhanced.tsv \
        --analysis all \
        --execute \
        --reflect \
        --model gpt-4o \
        --caption-model gpt-4o-mini

Arguments:
    --data: Path to splice sites TSV file (default: data/splice_sites_enhanced.tsv)
    --analysis: Analysis type (high_alternative_splicing, splice_site_genomic_view, 
                site_type_distribution, all, exploratory)
    --question: Research question for exploratory analysis (required if --analysis exploratory)
    --model: OpenAI model for code generation (default: gpt-4o-mini)
    --reflection-model: Model for reflection/critique (default: same as --model)
    --reflect: Enable reflection pattern for higher quality (costs more)
    --max-iterations: Maximum reflection iterations (default: 2)
    --output-dir: Directory to save generated charts (default: output/splice_analysis)
    --standard-only: Filter to standard chromosomes only (chr1-22, chrX, chrY)
    --execute: Execute code and generate PNG + PDF plots with captions and manifest
    --caption-model: Model for caption generation (default: gpt-4o-mini)

DOMAIN CONTEXT: Genomic Splice Site Analysis (MANE Dataset - GRCh38)

This dataset contains splice sites from MANE (Matched Annotation from NCBI and EBI) transcripts:
- **Dataset**: 369,918 splice sites from 18,200 genes and 18,264 transcripts
- **Splice Site Types**: donor (5' splice site with GT) and acceptor (3' splice site with AG)
- **Genomic Coverage**: 65 chromosomes (24 standard + 41 alternative/fix patches)
  - 99.6% on standard chromosomes (chr1-22, chrX, chrY)
  - 0.4% on alternative contigs and fix patches
- **Key Columns**:
  - chrom, position: Genomic coordinates
  - site_type: donor or acceptor (perfectly balanced: 184,959 each)
  - strand: + or - (nearly balanced: 50.2% vs 49.8%)
  - gene_name: HGNC gene symbol (e.g., 'TP53', 'OR4F5')
  - gene_id: Format 'gene-{SYMBOL}'
  - transcript_id: RefSeq format 'rna-{ID}.{version}'
  - exon_rank: Exon position in transcript (1-363, avg 11.64)

VISUALIZATION BEST PRACTICES:
- Use gene_name directly for gene symbols (no extraction needed)
- Color-code by site_type (donor vs acceptor) and strand
- Leverage exon_rank for transcript structure analysis
- Filter to standard chromosomes for primary analyses
- Use vertical bars for genomic position plots
