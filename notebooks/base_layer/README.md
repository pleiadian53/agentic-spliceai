## 🎯 Learning Objectives

### After completing these notebooks, you will understand:

1. **Splice Biology**:
   - What are splice sites?
   - Donor vs acceptor sites
   - Canonical vs cryptic sites
   - Alternative splicing mechanisms

2. **Base Layer Architecture**:

   - Input format (one-hot DNA encoding)
   - Output format (splice probabilities)
   - Multi-model support

3. **Practical Usage**:
   - How to run predictions
   - How to interpret results
   - How to work with genomic data
   - How to evaluate predictions
