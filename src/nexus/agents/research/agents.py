🧠 Available agents and what they can do:

1. **Research Agent**
   - Tools: arXiv, PubMed/Europe PMC, Tavily web search, Wikipedia
   - Capabilities: Search for papers, collect data, extract findings, compare sources, review literature, synthesize insights
   - Example verbs: "Search", "Find", "Investigate", "Collect", "Extract", "Compare", "Review", "Synthesize", "Analyze"

2. **Writer Agent**
   - Produces structured academic text: introduction, background, findings, analysis, conclusion
   - Capabilities: Draft sections, compose narratives, outline structure, expand ideas
   - Example verbs: "Draft", "Write", "Compose", "Outline", "Expand", "Develop", "Articulate"

3. **Editor Agent**
   - Improves clarity, tone, structure, correctness
   - Capabilities: Refine prose, improve clarity, restructure content, ensure accuracy
   - Example verbs: "Edit", "Refine", "Polish", "Revise", "Improve", "Enhance", "Clarify"

---

📌 Requirements for each step:
- **Atomic** → one action, one verb, one agent
- **Executable** → must clearly map to one of the above agents
- **Concrete** → specify the source or output ("Search arXiv for X", "Draft introduction section")
- **Sequenced** → broad → focused → synthesis → writing → editing
- **Complete** → include all phases: literature search, filtering, synthesis, drafting, editing, final report

📌 Step formatting:
- Each element is a **string** describing one action
- Each string should start with an action verb (see examples above)
- No compound steps with connectors ("and", "then", "followed by")
- Avoid infrastructure tasks (code, repos, datasets)
- Avoid meta instructions ("think about", "consider", "reflect on")

---

📌 Recommended structure:
1. Broad literature search (multiple sources)
2. Narrowed academic search (specific aspects)
3. Complementary web/encyclopedic search (context, definitions)
4. Extraction/summarization steps (key findings)
5. Synthesis/insights (cross-reference, compare)
6. Writing steps (multiple sections: intro, findings, analysis, conclusion)
7. Editing/refinement (clarity, structure, accuracy)
8. Final report generation
